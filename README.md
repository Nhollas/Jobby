# Jobby
##### TODO: Create Logo..

Jobby keeps track of every detail about your job applications - notes, dates, tasks, job descriptions, salaries, locations, company data and more.

### Idea / Use Case
 The idea for this project came from my recent experience with managing different job applications. I found that managing different contacts, progress and opportunities would often get confusing. The main goal of this project is to streamline the job application process and create a unique web application that is easy to use and scalable.
