# ðŸ§ª Frontend Testing

This projects frontend gets most of it's testing benefit from the integration and e2e tests. The Unit tests are fine, but they will not give you as much confidence that your application is working as integration tests do.

## What tests does the repo have?

### Unit Tests

Unit testing, as the naming already reveals is a type of testing where units of an application are being tested in isolation. You should write unit tests for shared components and functions that are used throughout the entire application as they might be used in different scenarios which might be difficult to reproduce in integration tests.

[Unit Test Example Code](../src/components/Elements/ConfirmationDialog/__tests__/ConfirmationDialog.test.tsx)

### Integration Tests

Integration testing is a method of testing multiple parts of an application at once.
Most of your tests should be integration tests, as these will give you the most benefits and confidence for your invested effort. Unit tests on their own don't guarantee that your app will work even if those tests pass, because the relationship between the units might be wrong. You should test different features with integration tests.

[Integration Test Example Code](../src/features/discussions/routes/__tests__/Discussion.test.tsx)

### E2E

End-To-End Testing is a testing method where an application is tested as a complete entity.
Usually these tests consist of running the entire application with the frontend and the backend in an automated way and verifying that the entire system works. It is usually written in the way the application should be used by the user.

[E2E Example Code](../cypress/integration/smoke.ts)

## Tooling:

#### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

Jest is a fully featured testing framework and is de-facto standard when it comes to testing JavaScript applications. It is very flexible and configurable to test both frontends and backends.

#### [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

Testing library is a set of libraries and tools that makes testing easier than ever before. Its philosophy is to test your app in a way it is being used by a real world user instead of testing implementation details. For example, don't test what is the current state value in a component, but test what that component renders on the screen for its user. If you refactor your app to use a different state management solution, the tests will still be relevant as the actual component output to the user didn't change.

## How do these things work together?
