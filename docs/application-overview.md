The application contains the following models:

```ts
/* 
    A user can have multiple boards. 
    The board serves as the top level data model.
*/
type Board = {
  reference: string;
  createdDate: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  name: string;
  lists: JobList[];
};
```

```ts
/* 
    A board can have multiple job lists. 
    These lists house the their respective jobs.
*/
export type JobList = {
  name: string;
  boardReference: string;
  jobs: Job[];
} & Entity;
```

```ts
/* 
    A job list can have multiple jobs.
    A job is the main data model of the application.
*/
type Job = {
  reference: string;
  createdDate: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
